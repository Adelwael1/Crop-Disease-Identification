# Crop Disease Identification Using Machine Learning
As a Data Scientist, this project focuses on developing an AI-powered crop disease identification system to help farmers and agricultural experts detect plant diseases early. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the system can analyze leaf images, classify diseases, and recommend appropriate treatments, ultimately improving crop health and yield.

 ## Key Objectives:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather a dataset of healthy and diseased crop images, apply augmentation techniques, and normalize data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze patterns in diseased vs. healthy crops, identify key visual features, and evaluate dataset quality.

Feature Extraction & Model Development: Train deep learning models such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet) for image classification.

Model Evaluation & Optimization: Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

Deployment & Real-World Application: Deploy the model as a mobile app or web-based tool, allowing farmers to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

This project contributes to precision agriculture, empowering farmers with data-driven disease detection, reducing crop loss, and enhancing sustainable farming practices.
